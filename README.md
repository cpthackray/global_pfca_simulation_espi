Co-authorship is appropriate if your paper benefits significantly from use of this model/code. Citation is appropriate if use of this model/code has only a marginal impact on your work or if the work is a second generation application of the model/code. 

# Submitting bugs

If you find a bug, please report it to us (thackray@seas.harvard.edu) with the subject "Global PFCA model: bug report". We'll fix it, document it, and post corrected code online. 

# Software requirements

This model is incorporated into the Tropchem simulation of GEOS-Chem 12.2.0 and has the same software requirements.
